# Code-Ninjas-Accesability-Extenstion

Download and unzip
Go to chrome and navigate the menu to extenstions
 - or go to chrome://extensions/

enable Developer mode

Drag the new unzipped file onto the tab to install
- or click "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the unzipped folder

to change the font go to the extenstion button next to the search bar click the code ninjas font changer and tick the box
- if the font doesnt change try to refresh the page (if the page still doesnt change then we dont have correct permissions to change the font i am working on this but cant promise it will be fixed)

to activate Text to speech just highlight the text and right click where you should see the option!
- (if it doesnt work then the same permission issue applies)


All updates will be posted to the discord when needed!
